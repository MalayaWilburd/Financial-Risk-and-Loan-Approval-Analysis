# Financial-Risk-and-Loan-Approval-Analysis
This project analyzes a banking dataset to assess financial risk in loan approvals. 
Using SQL for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and Power BI for interactive dashboards, the project identifies key drivers of loan approval, including income, debt-to-income ratio, and job tenure. 
The dashboard includes visualizations for year-over-year trends, approval rates, and income distribution.
